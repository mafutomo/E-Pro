# E/PRO

### This fitness application is primarily designed for the scheduling of workout and nutritional regimen in harmony to the female hormonal cycle.

The lead-in page summarizes the app functionality and brings users to a log-in and registration module.  New clients will be brought to a registration page that collects their name, email, password, first day of last period, cycle length, age, and birth control method.  Upon clicking submit, new users will be brought to a personal page that details a suggested workout and nutritional regimen based on estrogen and progesterone levels.  The estrogen and progesterone levels are calculated from medical surveys on the contraceptive's specific effects on hormonal levels.  Registered users will always have access to the workout/nutritional regimen page contingent upon logging in with the correct email and password.  The top navigation bar houses both the E/Pro title and a triple bar that triggers a left-side drawer.  This left-side drawer leads both to the user's personal page and a userbase page.  The userbase page provides metadata on the entire userbase which details the number of users by age, contraceptive methods by number of users, and contraceptive methods by age and number of users.
